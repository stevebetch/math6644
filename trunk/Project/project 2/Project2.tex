\section*{Fixed-point and Newton's Method for Nonlinear systems}

{\it Consider the discrete Chandrasekhar H-equation:

$$F_i(\vec{x})=x_i -(1-\frac{c}{2N}\sum\limits^N_{j=1}\frac{\mu_ix_j}{\mu_i+\mu_j})^{-1}=0
$$
where $c \in(0,1)$ is a given constant, $\mu_i=\frac{(i-\frac{1}){2}}{N}$ for $1\le i \le N$ and $N$ is the dimension of the unknown vector $\vec{x}$. Write your own code and compute the solution of the equation for $N=200$ and $c=0.9$ by using:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fixed-point method,
\item Chord method,
\item Newton method,
\item Shamanskii method with $m=2$.
\end{enumerate}
In all of the computations, the initial guess is taken as $\vec{x}=[1,1,\dots,1]^T$ and the stopping condition is given.

The Chandrasekhar H-equation was introduced by astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar is used to solve exit distribution problems in radiative transfer. In the world of Numerical Methods, this equation serves as a well-understood problem that nonlinear solvers can tackle. In this project, the Fixed point and variations on Newton's methods were used to solve the discrete Chandrasekhar H-equation with a constant of $c=0.9$ and $N=200$. These four methods are all able to solve nonlinear systems of equations with various rates of convergence. For all of these methods, the standard assumptions are held.

\subsection*{Fixed-Point Method}
The Fixed point method is a nonlinear solver that relies on contraction mapping to find a solution. The Fixed point iteration is given by:
$$ \vec{x_{n+1}}=\vec{x_n}-F(\vec{x_n})
$$
By inducing a contraction mapping, given by $ \vec{x}=k(\vec{x})$, the method will converge, so long as the following conditions are met:
$$||k(\vec{x})-k(\vec{y})||\le \gamma ||\vec{x}-\vec{y}|| \ \ \ \ 0<\gamma<1
$$
where $k(\vec{x})=\vec{x}_{n+1}$, $k(\vec{y}),\vec{y}=\vec{x}^*$ and $\gamma$ is a constant.  The Fixed-point method may not converge as quickly as other methods, but it is a relatively straight forward method and does not need to calculate a Jacobian matrix to converge. This can be a huge advantage over the Newton's family of methods, should finding the Jacobian prove to be difficult or costly.

\subsection*{Newton Method}
Newton's method is a numerical method that iteratively finds successively better approximations to the zeros of a real function. The Newton iteration is defined as:
$$\vec{x}_{n+1}=\vec{x}_n-\frac{F(\vec{x}_n)}{F'(\vec{x}_n)}
$$
where $F(\vec{x})$ is the value of the function $F$ at $\vec{x}$ and  $F'(\vec{x})$ is the derivative of $F(\vec{x})$. Newton's method has an advantage over the Fixed point method when looking at the convergence rate. While the Fixed point method is expected to converge at a linear rate, Newton's method is able to converge quadratically. The convergence rate is governed by:
$$||\vec{x}_{n+1}-\vec{x}^*||\le k||\vec{x}_n-\vec{x}^*||^2
$$
where $\vec{x}^*$ is the solution and k is a constant governed by $0<k<1$. As can be seen by the squared term on the right hand side, the error should be decreasing at a quadratic rate. One issue with Newton's method is solving the step $F'(\vec{x}_n)\vec{s}=-F(\vec{x}_n)$. This step requires not only solving a linear system of equations, but also requires the formation of the Jacobian at each step. If the Jacobian is costly to evaluate, this method may take more time to converge, while still having fewer iterations, than other methods. 


\subsection*{Chord Method}
The Chord method is a variation on Newton's method that attempts to minimize the cost of evaluating the Jacobian. The  iterative step used in the Chord method is nearly identical to that of Newton's method, but has one small change:
$$\vec{x}_{n+1}=\vec{x}_n-\frac{F(\vec{x}_n)}{F'(\vec{x}_0)}
$$
Instead of using a Jacobian calculated at each step, the Jacobian is calculated at the start and the LU factorized version of this initial Jacobian is used for the rest of the iterations:
$$LU\vec{s}=-F(\vec{x}_n)
$$
By only having to calculate the Jacobian once and only factoring it once, the Chord method is able to speed up the computation at the cost of more iterations. The Chord method gives up the quadratic convergence of Newton's method to achieve speedups in computation. The error of the Chord method is governed by:
$$||\vec{x}_{n+1}-\vec{x}^*||\le k||\vec{e}_0||\ ||\vec{e}_n||
$$
where $||\vec{e}_0||$ is the norm of the initial error, given by $||\vec{e}_0||=||\vec{x}_0-\vec{x}^*||$, and $||\vec{e}_n||$ is the norm of the error at step n. From the above equation we know that the error converges at a locally linear rate.

\subsection*{Shamanskii Method with $m=2$}
The Shamanskii method attempts to hybridize the Chord method with Newton's method. The Shamanskii method uses the parameter $m$ to determine how many chord iterations will be performed prior to recomputing and refactorizing the Jacobian. This allows the Shamanskii method to maintain a higher order convergence while still minimizing the number of times the Jacobian is computed. The error of the Shamanskii method is governed by:
$$||\vec{e}_{n+1}||\le k_s||\vec{e}_n||^{m+1}
$$
where $||\vec{e}_n||=||\vec{x}_n-\vec{x}^*||$, and $k_s$ is a constant.
